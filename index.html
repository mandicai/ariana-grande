            <h1>The Progression of Ariana Grande</h1>
            <p>Since the release of her debut album <i>Yours Truly</i> in 2013, Ariana Grande has sold 30.5 million digital singles. She was named as one of <i>TIME</i>'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2016, and has been nominated for 4 Grammy's.
              I wanted to visualize how her albums have evolved over the years, given that she has a four octave soprano vocal range to work with.
            </p>
            <p>These charts use Spotify's audio features to characterize her music. Acousticness, danceability, energy, and valence are quantified on a scale of 0 to 1.
              <ul>
                <li><b>Acousticness</b> is a "confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic."</li>
                <li><b>Danceability</b> "describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity."</li>
                <li><b>Energy</b> represents "represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity."</li>
                <li><b>Valence</b> is a "measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track."</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
